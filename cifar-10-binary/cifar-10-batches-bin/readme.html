CIFAR-10 CNN Classification
A convolutional neural network (CNN) classification model on the CIFAR-10 dataset using TensorFlow and Keras.

What the project does
This project trains a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into one of 10 classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck. The model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras, and achieves a test accuracy of approximately 85%.

Why the project is useful
This project is useful for several reasons:

It provides a simple and easy-to-understand implementation of a CNN for image classification tasks.
It serves as a baseline model for more complex image classification tasks.
It demonstrates the use of TensorFlow and Keras for building and training deep learning models.
Overview
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. This project trains a CNN model to classify these images into their respective classes.

Requirements
TensorFlow 2.x
Keras 2.x
Python 3.x
NumPy
Matplotlib
Running the Code
To run the code, simply execute the cifar10_cnn.py script in your terminal or command prompt.
